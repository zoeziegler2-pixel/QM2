Think of it as google docs but for code-- it will be very useful for collaborating on your group projects later in the term, and in your future as a data analyst.\n",

        "In this course, we'll make extensive use of *Python*, a programming language used widely in scientific computing and on the web. We will be using Python as a way to manipulate, plot and analyse data. This isn't a course about learning Python, it's about working with data - but we'll learning a little bit of programming along the way.\n",
        "\n",
        "By now, you should have done the prerequisites for the module, and understand a bit about how Python is structured, what different commands do, and so on - this is a bit of a refresher to remind you of what we need at the beginning of term.\n",

        "The particular flavour of Python we're using is *iPython*, which, as we've seen, allows us to combine text, code, images, equations and figures in a *Notebook*. This is a *cell*, written in *markdown* - a way of writing nice text. Contrast this with *code* cell, which executes a bit of Python:"

No longer does the English commentary injected into a program have to be hidden in comment delimiters at the top of the file, or under procedure headings, or at the end of lines. Instead, it is wrenched into the daylight and made the main focus. The \"program\" then becomes primarily a document directed at humans, with the code being herded between \"code delimiters\" from where it can be extracted and shuffled out sideways to the language system by literate programming tools.\n",
